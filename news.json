  "title": "Comprehensive Guide to Claiming Tax Deductions Under the Old Regime for AY 2025-26",
  "content": "As taxpayers prepare for the upcoming tax filing season for Assessment Year 2025-26, it's crucial to understand the various deductions available under the old tax regime, particularly for those who have opted out of the new, simplified regime. This year, the focus remains on maximizing eligible exemptions to reduce taxable income. Key areas to review include Section 80C for investments in PPF, ELSS, life insurance premiums, and home loan principal repayments, which has a maximum limit of Rs. 1.5 lakhs. Additionally, Section 80D allows for deductions on health insurance premiums, with higher limits for senior citizens and parents. Interest paid on housing loans for self-occupied property can be claimed under Section 24(b) up to Rs. 2 lakhs, while rented properties have no upper limit on interest claims. Furthermore, contributions to the National Pension System (NPS) under Section 80CCD(1B) offer an additional deduction of Rs. 50,000, over and above the 80C limit. Taxpayers should also remember deductions for interest on education loans (Section 80E), donations to approved institutions (Section 80G), and specific medical treatments for dependent family members (Section 80DDB). Maintaining proper documentation, such as investment proofs, premium receipts, and loan statements, is paramount to avoid discrepancies during assessment. It's advisable to consult a tax professional to ensure all eligible deductions are claimed correctly and to navigate any recent minor amendments to the Income Tax Act for AY 2025-26 that might impact these claims.",
